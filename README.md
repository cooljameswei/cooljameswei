* Senior software engineer heavily focusing on web development as a full-stack.
* My focus is to help clients with their business by fixing and creating projects of value.
* I have experience working as an individual developer and a project manager in many projects providing me with the skills of communicating with clients to satisfy their needs.
* My experience tells everybody who I am, what I can do for your project.
* A day in my life may consist of : prepping web art, fixing some front-end bugs, adding an API endpoint, dockerizing an application, database design, configuring a unit or UI test library, setting up a build or deployment plan, provisioning a test tier machine or feature work.
